# Overview
One of my biggest hobbies is basketball. I watch a lot of NBA and play often. I also really enjoy writing software and so I decided to find a way to combine the two. I have breifly worked with pandas in the past so I decided to revist it and see if I could get some good practice in while enjoying basketball.

# Data Analysis Results

### Question 1: is there a correlation between player height and points averaged? 

Based off of the results there seems to be no correlation between the height of a player and the points they average.

### Question 2: Is there any correlation between the weight of a player and the amount of games played in a season?

From the data being in either extreme of heavy or light leads a player to be more likely to play less games in a season. This is most likely because those in either extreme 
are more likely to be injured.
